# This is your preferences dialog.
#
# Define your preferences dictionary in the __init__.main() function.
# The widget names in the PreferencesTestProjectDialog.ui
# file need to correspond to the keys in the preferences dictionary.
#
# Each preference also need to be defined in the 'widget_methods' map below
# to show up in the dialog itself.  Provide three bits of information:
#  1) The first entry is the method on the widget that grabs a value from the
#     widget.
#  2) The second entry is the method on the widget that sets the widgets value
#      from a stored preference.
#  3) The third entry is a signal the widget will send when the contents have
#     been changed by the user. The preferences dictionary is always up to
# date and will signal the rest of the application about these changes.
# The values will be saved to desktopcouch when the application closes.
#
# TODO: replace widget_methods with your own values
